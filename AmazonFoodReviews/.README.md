### Final notebooks
Point out that:
    - I did this in Python cause I prefer R and I wanted the challenge
  	- I hadn't used Scikit learn in a while, so this is my first try to use it again
    - The pipeline was super interesting to me as this is a big part of the data scientist experience, when you get to cross over to "computer science"
    - Then it gets even more interesting when using big data platforms. Like using ml flow where you can schedule work and you get back model performance metrics which can feed a model dashboard for example
